# The PDB database 

The main repository for biomolecular data is the PDB (protein data bank) and can be found at: http://www.rcsb.org/

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```


```{r}
nocomma <- sub(",", "", pdbstats$X.ray)
sum(as.numeric(nocomma))
```


```{r}
library(readr)
pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```
The resulting column names are "untidy" with spaces and mixed cases. We can use the **janitor** package and its `clean_names()` function to fix this. 

```{r}
library(janitor)
df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

Percent of structures in PDB solved by:
x-ray: 82.83549 %
EM: 10.75017 %

```{r}
n.xray <- sum(df$x_ray)
n.em <- sum(df$em)
n.total <- sum(df$total)
n.xray
n.em
n.total
```

```{r}
n.xray/n.total * 100
n.em/n.total * 100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(df$total[1]/n.total * 100, digits = 2)
```
>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

231,029 structures

In uniprot there are 253206171 sequences and only 231,029 known structures in the PDB. 

```{r}
231029/253206171 * 100
```


## 2. Molecular visualization with Mol*

https://molstar.org/ 

my first image from Mol* of HIV-Pr

![Fig. 1: A first view of HIV-Pr dimer](1HSG.png)


I want an image that shows the binding cleft of MK1 inhibitor, an image of the most valuable water in history, and an image of the ASP cleft

![Binding cleft](1HSG (1).png)

## Using the Bio3D package

Bio3D is an R package for structural bioinformatics. Features include the ability to read, write and analyze biomolecular structure, sequence and dynamic trajectory data.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

>Q. how many amino acids in this structure:

```{r}
s <- pdbseq(hiv)
head(s)
length(s)
```

## Predict functional motions

Let's read a new structure

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```

Normal mode analysis (NMA)

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m, sse=pdb)
```

To view a “movie” of these predicted motions we can generate a molecular “trajectory” with the mktrj() function.

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="results.pdb")
```

## 5: Comparative structure analysis of Adenylate Kinase *

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

```{r}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
hits <- plot(b)
```
```{r}
head(b$raw)
```


```{r}
head(hits$pdb.id)
```

Download all these structures to our project dir:

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

## align and superpose

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

## PCA 

```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
plot(pc.xray, pc.axes = c(1,2))
```
